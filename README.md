# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-of-CPPI
Plot the results of a Monte Carlo Simulation of CPPI that are dynamic and changeable

  """
    Plot the results of a Monte Carlo Simulation of CPPI:

    1- Use "geometric_brownian_motion" function to create set of returns as risky returns.

    2- Use "cppi_running" function to use the risky returns for CPPI strategy.

    3- You can change the parameters of interactive show.
